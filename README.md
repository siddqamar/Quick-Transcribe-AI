# Quick Transcribe AI

 If you take notes, you already know how useful it is to have transcriptions of lectures, meetings, phone calls, even YouTube videos. With that in mind, Iâ€™ve built an app and making it public for everyone as a Docker container.


## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- A Hugging Face API token (get one from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))

## Setup

1. Fork/Clone this repository
2. Copy the example environment file and add your Hugging Face token:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit `.env` and replace `<your-token>` with your actual Hugging Face API token

## Building and Running

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t quick-transcribe-ai .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 7860:7860 -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env:ro quick-transcribe-ai
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:7860`

## Features

- Supports audio and video both
- Real-time transcription using Whisper large-v3-turbo model
- Clean and intuitive Gradio interface
- Downloadable transcription results
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Notes

- The application uses the `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` model from Hugging Face
- Make sure your Hugging Face API token has sufficient permissions
- The container exposes port 7860 for the Gradio interface
